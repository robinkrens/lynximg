lynximg is a simple tool for Atari Lynx to convert
bitmap files to a format that is understood by the
Atari Lynx.

Currently supported:
	- Uncompressed 24-bit .bmp files
	- Compressed 24-bit .bmp files
 
You can use GIMP to export .bmp as 24 (r8/b8/g8) bits .bmp
files. 

Output is 4 bits per pixels (define as in Sprite Control
Block as BPP4) 

Usage: lynximg [file] 
A file will be written with the same name, but with a .lyi 
format. You can compile this file with your game.
